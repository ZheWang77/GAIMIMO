<h2>‚ö° Setting Up LangChain with Database based on RAG</h2>
<p>Set up LangChain based on <a href="https://github.com/RickyZang/GIAI" target="_blank">this repository</a>. The database is established by merging research papers about the performance analysis of XL-MIMO:

<h2>üîç Case Study 1: Capacity Maximization for Non-Parallel Transceiver</h2>
    <p>We formulate the capacity maximization problem for non-parallel tranceiver. The interactive assistance from the generative AI agent can be implemented (an exmaple):</p>

		<p>With the assitance of the generative AI agent, we can study the capacity maximization problem for non-parallel tranceiver. We use Matlab to implement performance evaluation. We consider one square transmitting UPA surface and one square receiving UPA surface with similar physical sizes $10\lambda \times 10\lambda$. The transmitting distances between the center point of the transmitter and the center point of the transmitter for (a) and (b) are $30\lambda$ and $4\lambda$, respectively. And the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) $P/N_0=10$.</p>

    <h2>üîç Case Study 2: EDoF Maximization for Various Shapes of Transceiver</h2>
    <p>We then study the EDoF maximization problem for various shapes of transceiver. The interactive assistance from the generative AI agent can be implemented (an exmaple):</p>

				<p>We can efficiently formulate the EDoF maximization problem for various shapes of transceiver with the assistance of the generative AI agent. We apply Matlab to implement simulation evaluation. We have $L=12\lambda$ and transmitting distance $d=10\lambda$.</p>
